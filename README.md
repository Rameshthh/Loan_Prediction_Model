# Loan_Prediction_Model

# Loan Prediction Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on various applicant and loan attributes. It is based on a classification problem and uses historical data from a financial institution.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build a classification model to predict loan approval
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Deploy the model or demonstrate predictions

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ machine learning

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load the dataset using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical columns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize distributions, relationships, and outliers in the data.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Transform raw features into meaningful inputs for the model.

5. **Model Building**  
   Use classification algorithms like:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
